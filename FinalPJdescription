 
FINAL PROJECT

DESCRITION OF THE ISSUE

A restourant owner want to open a second restourant in another area in NY city but doesnt know where will be the best
location for it.
Right now he has a tier 2 Italian restourant in the Queens area and he wants to open another one in another NY neighborhood, he would also like to step un the quality of the new restourant so he hopes to find a neighborhood that will welcome a tier 3 or tier 4 restourant.
We will use data from the FourSquare API to determine where to open it based on the success of the tier 3 and 4 italian restourants in a specific neighborhood

DESCRITION OF THE PROJECT

In this project will be analized all the neighborhoods in New York and with the collected data will be determined
in wich specific area to open a tier 3 or above Italian restourant based on the neighborhood reviews scores of Italian Restourants.

DATA USED

We will be used data from the geocoder library to separate in neighborhoods the city of New York.
We will use the data from FourSquare to list all the italian venues in a radious of 1000 meters around the center of each neighborhood.
The data that we will collect from FourSquare will be the one regarding the price range of the restourants and the review score average of all of those
Where tier 1 is the cheaper and tier 4 is the most expensive, those will later be clusterized and using a K-means algorithm and we will be able to make a good prediction to understand in wich neighborhood a specific Italian tier 3 and above restourant will be lucrative and well accepted.
